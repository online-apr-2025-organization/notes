OOPS concepts
-------------
4 main pillars of OOPS

A - Abstraction
P - Polymorphism
I - Inheritance
E - Encapsulation


Inheritance
-----------
	- one class can extend another class
	- the class that is extended is called base class/super class/parent class
	- the class which extends is called derived class/sub class/child class
	- the moment we extend a class the child class can access all the members of the parent class as if it were its own
	- we get code reusability
	- we can inherit using extends keyword
	- make sure that the is-a relation is satisfied

	- types of inheritance
	----------------------
		- single level inheritance
		- multilevel inheritance
			class A{}
			class B extends A{}
			class C extends B{}
		- hirarchial inheritance
		- multiple inheritance - not supported in java

			class A{}
			class B{}
			class C extends A,B{} ---->this is multiple inheritance
Polymorphism
------------
	- more than one form
	- 2 types of polymorphism
		- compile time polymorphism
			eg : method overloading
			- 2 or more methods with the same name but different parameters
			- we do not consider the return type in method overloading

				int mark = 20;
				System.out.println(mark);

				boolean flag = false;
				System.out.println(flag);
		- runtime polymorphism
			eg: method overriding
			- inheritance is a pre-requisite of method overriding
			- same method name and signature in parent class and child class
			- when we create an object of the child class and call the method,the method in the child overrides/masks the method of the parent class and the method in the child class is called
