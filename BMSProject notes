POJO - Plain Old Java Object / DTO - Data Transfer Objects / TO - Transfer Objects / Model

3 layered project
-----------------
	- presentation layer
		- UI
		- Input/output
		- this layer calls the service layer in case of any logic to be performed
		- in BMS Project I have used the main method as the presentation layer
	- service/business logic layer
		- contains the logic
		- there should no input and output statements
		- if the service layer needs to interact with the data store, it will call the methods of the dao layer
	- dao(Data Access Object) layer
		- responsible for interacting with the data store
		- initially our data store will be a collection, this is a temporary, once we know JDBC we will use 
JDBC to interact with an external Database
		- the dao class will be abstracted through an interface
